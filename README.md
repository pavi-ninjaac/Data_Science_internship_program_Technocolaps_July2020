# Data Science internship program Technocolaps July2020-Aug 2020
This is my journey fo data science internship at technocolaps. Here i am going to write the day by day activities of this internship and write about my assignments and projects and learing path.
# Day 1:

##### learning about what is data science and some importance of basic level:
# 2. What is Data Science?
Before we start the Data Science Tutorial, we should find out what data science really is.
Data science is a way to try and discover hidden patterns in raw data. To achieve this goal, it makes use of several algorithms, machine learning(ML) principles, and scientific methods. The insights it retrieves from data lie in forms structured and unstructured. So in a way, this is like data mining. Data science encompasses all- data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. With more practices being labelled into data science, the term itself becomes diluted beyond usefulness. This leads to variation in curricula for introductory data science courses worldwide.
# data science history:
In 90’s
- 1960- Peter Naur uses the term as a substitute for computer science.
- 1974- Peter Naur publishes Concise Survey of Computer Methods, uses a term in a survey of contemporary data processing methods.
- 1996- Biennial conference in Kobe; members of the IFCS (International Federation of Classification Societies include the term in the conference title.
- 1997- November- Professor C.F. Jeff Wu delivers inaugural lecture on the topic “Statistics=Data Science?”.
b. In 2000’s
- 2001- William S. Cleveland introduces data science as an independent discipline in article Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics.
- 2002- April- The ICSU (International Council for Science): Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) starts Data Science Journal- this publication is to focus on issues pertaining to data systems- description, publication, application, and also legal issues.
- 2003- January- Columbia University publishes journal The Journal of Data Science- a platform that allows data workers to exchange ideas.
- 2005- National Science Board publishes Long-lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century- this provides a new definition to the term “data scientists”.
- 2007- Jim Gray, Turing awardee, envisions data-driven science as the fourth paradigm of science.
- 2012- Harvard Business Review article attributes coinage of the term to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008.
- 2013- IEEE launches a task force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics; first European Conference on Data Analysis (ECDA)organized in Luxembourg, European Association for Data Science (EuADS) comes into existence.
- 2014- IEEE launches first international conference International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics; General Assembly launches student-paid Bootcamp, The Data Incubator launches data science fellowship for free.
- 2015- Springer launches International Journal on Data Science and Analytics.
# Data science tools:
-  Machine Learning for Pattern Discovery
-  Machine Learning for Making Predictions
- Predictive Causal Analytics
- Prescriptive Analytics
# MARKDOWN SYNTAX
Adding italics and bold:
> '*Italics* **Bold**'
# Adding headers (titles) of various sizes:
# header one ## header two
# Adding hyperlinks and images:
'[Link](http://a.com)'
# Adding block quotes:
'> Blockquote'
# Adding lists:
'* * *'
 # Adding horizontal lines:
'‐‐‐'
# Adding inline code:
`Inline code with backticks`
# Adding code blocks
``` code ```
# JUPYTER NOTEBOOK SPECIAL COMMAND
# Displaying the code execution history:
- %history -p

# Types of modes in Jupyter:
- Jupyter is in edit mode whenever we type in a cell — a small pencil icon appears to the right of the menu bar.
- Jupyter is in command mode whenever we press Esc or whenever we click outside of the cell — the pencil to the right of the menu bar disappears.
- State refers to what a computer remembers about a program.
- We can convert a code cell to a Markdown cell to add text to explain our code. Markdown syntax allows us to use keyboard symbols to format our text.

# Some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts we can use in command mode are:
- Ctrl + Enter: run selected cell
- Shift + Enter: run cell, select below
- Alt + Enter: run cell, insert below
- Up: select cell above
- Down: select cell below
- Enter: enter edit mode
- A: insert cell above
- B: insert cell below
- D, D (press D twice): delete selected cell
- Z: undo cell deletion
- S: save and checkpoint
- Y: convert to code cell
- M: convert to Markdown cell
# Some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts we can use in edit mode are:
- Ctrl + Enter: run selected cell
- Shift + Enter: run cell, select below
- Alt + Enter: run cell, insert below
- Up: move cursor up
- Down: move cursor down
- Esc: enter command mode
- Ctrl + A: select all
- Ctrl + Z: undo
- Ctrl + Y: redo
- Ctrl + S: save and checkpoint
- Tab : indent or code completion
- Shift + Tab: tooltip
